       <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      To all my vegetarian friends, when you have a craving for Italian food, then this is a ‘must’ place to visit. Its Roman-style pizzas are simply amazing. Thin, crisp crust with that perfect amount of sauce and cheese, pizzas here will make one forget that pizza needs to be overloaded with meat to taste well. Whether solo or catching up with friends, their pizzas are light and super satisfying. One more thing which I liked about this restaurant was the entire overall vibe of the restaurant. The place was very lively and the waiters were extremely nice and caring.
